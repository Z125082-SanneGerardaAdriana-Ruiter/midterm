<!--I have never made a website before, so I used canva to design it and put text and images in there to give me
A good Idea of what I wanted. After that I used the lessons form html to set up de basis. This made it easy to
Copy paste everything since I already had a idea of what I wated and which text to use

          <h2>Get to know me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi i am Sanne - I am a 21-years-old Business/AI computer science
            student.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream is to become a business IT manager who understands both
            code and people. I would like to know enough about programming to
            support my team, but more importantly: to understand the people I
            work with — especially in multicultural settings.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m passionate about learning how culture shapes communication and
            collaboration, whether it's in a boardroom or a bento shop in Japan.
            I believe understanding each other starts with curiosity and
            respect.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I am not at school or programming I love hiking in the
            mountains, which is a great inspiration for most of my ideas.

            Hiking is more than just a hobby to me – it’s how I clear my mind
            and spark new ideas. Many of the concepts for this portfolio came to
            me while hiking through Japan. I believe walking every day helps me
            stay grounded and true to myself.

              For school, I had to create a project to learn more about the
              culture of the university I’d be attending abroad. I decided to
              include the first part of that project in this portfolio, since
              I’ve never really done anything before that felt worth sharing.
            </p>

            <p>
              I was so excited to learn how to build a website from scratch,
              especially since it could boost my skills for Business IT
              Management. As I love challenging myself, I created this entire
              website without using any templates—just pure HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. By first designing my portfolio in Canva, I have
              learned, step by step, how to bring my ideas to life.

                frontend development, but also in culture, communication, and
                storytelling. Every section of this portfolio reflects something
                I care about, from walking in nature to learning to respect
                other cultures.

                from different backgrounds and can support a diverse team with
                empathy, knowledge, and curiosity.

            <h2>What I have learned so far</h2>
            <p>
              During my stay in Japan, I’ve already learned a lot about Japanese
              culture. Although I don’t personally believe in any god, I was
              inspired by Shintoism, one of the two main religions in Japan.
              Shintoism and Buddhism have coexisted for over 1500 years and
              continue to shape Japanese traditions and daily life. To give a
              brief overview, I’ll highlight some of the key aspects of both
              Shintoism and Buddhism.

              <h3>Shintoism</h3>
              <p>
                Indigenous religion in Japan that focuses on nature, spirits
                (kami), and ancestor worship. It has no founder, sacred texts or
                strict doctrines. Practices include purification, offerings and
                festivals. Shrines (jinja) are Shinto places of worship,
                emphasizing harmony with nature and life.

                Foreign religion from India that focuses on enlightenment,
                karma, and escaping the cycle of rebirth. It has scriptures,
                rituals and many sects. Practices include meditation, chanting
                and ancestor worship. Temples (tera) are Buddhist places of

            <p>
              As someone who always tries to respect other cultures, the first
              few weeks in Japan were really challenging for me. I wasn’t used
              to the Japanese way of living and was constantly afraid of
              accidentally breaking social rules. But I learned that as long as
              you’re respectful and make an effort to follow local customs,
              you’ll be just fine. You don’t need to stress as much as I
              did—just be open and willing to learn.
